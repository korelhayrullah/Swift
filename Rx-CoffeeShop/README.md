# CoffeeShop - Introduction to RxSwift and RxCocoa

In this tutorial I followed a tutorial written by a friend of mine, [Göktuğ Gümüş](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goktuggumus/) on Medium. This tutorial's purpose was to change a non-reactive app to a reactive one. The assignment he gave in his tutorial is completed in this repo. You can read his artice from [here](https://medium.com/@goktuggumus/rxswift-ve-rxcocoaya-giri%C5%9F-92e6c6f87051). The artice is written in Turkish, so if translate doesn't work well, sorry you have to look for tutorials on Google. However, if you want, you can check the code and maybe understand or it may give you an opinion.

You can access the starter and final project written by Göktuğ [here](https://github.com/Goktug/RxSwift-RxCocoa-CoffeeShop-Medium).
